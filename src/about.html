        <p class="font-ubuntu">I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a PhD in Physics and am currently working with Dr. Tiziana Di Matteo and Dr. Rupert Croft on further developing super-resolution techniques for application in cosmological simulations. The ultimate goal is to use these super-resolution techniques to achieve high levels of detail in a short amount of time in simulations that would currently take the age of the universe to generate high levels of detail.</p>

        <p class="font-ubuntu">I've been involved in women's hockey analytics since Sept. 2018, and am one of the few people who do women's hockey analytics publicly. Currently, I am concentrating on archiving women's hockey analytics projects on metahockey.com to solidify the foundation of knowledge new and future women's hockey analysts will build off of.</p>
